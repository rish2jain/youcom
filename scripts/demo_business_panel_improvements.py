Demo Script: Business Panel Dashboard Improvements
Showcases the implementation of critical recommendations from the business expert panel review.

This script demonstrates:
1. Decision-Action Bridge: Transform risk scores into actionable recommendations
2. Progressive Disclosure UI: Three-tier information architecture
3. Learning Loop: Track alert outcomes and feed back to improve monitoring

Run this script to see the new features in action.
