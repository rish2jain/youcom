# Hackathon Success Strategy - You.com API Showcase

## 🎯 Winning Strategy: Maximum You.com API Integration

**Goal**: Win by demonstrating the most creative and comprehensive use of ALL 4 You.com APIs in a single, orchestrated workflow.

### The Killer Demo Flow (3 minutes)

```
User adds "OpenAI" to competitive watchlist
    ↓
📰 You.com News API: Real-time competitor monitoring
    ↓
🔍 You.com Search API: Entity enrichment & context gathering
    ↓
🤖 You.com Custom Agents: AI-powered competitive analysis
    ↓
📊 You.com ARI: Deep research report (400+ sources)
    ↓
💡 Impact Card: Risk score + recommendations + full citations
```

**Why This Wins**: Shows sophisticated API orchestration, not just "call one API and display results"

## 🏆 Hackathon-Optimized Task Priority

### MUST DO (Core Demo) - 48 Hours

- [ ] **Task 1**: You.com API Client with all 4 APIs integrated

  - News API for real-time monitoring
  - Search API for entity enrichment
  - Custom Agents for competitive analysis
  - ARI for deep research reports
  - Retry logic for demo stability (no API failures during judging)
  - _Demo Value: Shows technical depth and API mastery_

- [ ] **Task 2**: Single Killer Workflow - Watchlist to Impact Card

  - One perfect end-to-end flow in <5 minutes
  - Real-time updates via WebSocket during demo
  - Pre-seeded with 2-3 real competitors (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
  - _Demo Value: Live, working system that judges can interact with_

- [ ] **Task 3**: Impact Card UI (The Centerpiece)

  - Risk score gauge chart (Recharts) with color coding
  - Source citations showing You.com API depth
  - AI confidence scores for transparency
  - Trend arrows and actionable recommendations
  - _Demo Value: Memorable visual that judges will remember_

- [ ] **Task 4**: 3-Minute Demo Pitch
  - Problem (30s): "PMs waste 10+ hours/week tracking competitors"
  - Solution (90s): Live demo of watchlist → Impact Card
  - You.com Value (60s): "Only possible with You.com's 4 APIs"
  - _Demo Value: Clear story that highlights You.com APIs_

### NICE TO HAVE (If Time Permits)

- [ ] **Polish**: shadcn/ui components for professional look
- [ ] **Wow Factor**: Natural language queries → ARI reports
- [ ] **Export**: PDF/Slack sharing of Impact Cards
- [ ] **Mobile**: Responsive design shows completeness

### ❌ CUT FOR HACKATHON (Even Though In Specs)

- **Individual User Features**: Too broad, focus on enterprise PMs only
- **Advanced Compliance**: Judges won't test audit logs or RBAC
- **Multi-User Collaboration**: Adds complexity without You.com showcase
- **Extensive Testing**: Manual testing of demo flow is sufficient
- **Cost Optimization**: Simple usage counter, skip cost calculations

npx shadcn-ui@latest init  # Professional UI components
```

### You.com API Client (Demo-Stable)

```python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential
import httpx

class YouComClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.client = httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=30.0)

    @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=10))
    async def fetch_news(self, query: str):
        """News API - Real-time competitor monitoring"""
        response = await self.client.get(
            "https://api.you.com/v1/news",
            headers={"X-API-Key": self.api_key},
            params={"query": query, "count": 20}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()

    @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=10))
    async def search_context(self, query: str):
        """Search API - Entity enrichment"""
        response = await self.client.get(
            "https://api.you.com/v1/search",
            headers={"X-API-Key": self.api_key},
            params={"query": query, "count": 10}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()

    @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=10))
    async def analyze_competitive_impact(self, content: str):
        """Custom Agents - AI competitive analysis"""
        response = await self.client.post(
            "https://api.you.com/v1/agents/competitive-analysis",
            headers={"X-API-Key": self.api_key},
            json={"content": content, "format": "structured"}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()

    @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=10))
    async def generate_deep_research(self, query: str):
        """ARI - 400+ source research reports"""
        response = await self.client.post(
            "https://api.you.com/v1/research",
            headers={"X-API-Key": self.api_key},
            json={"query": query, "mode": "comprehensive", "sources": 400}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

## 🎨 Impact Card Design (Hero Component)

```typescript
interface ImpactCard {
  title: string; // "OpenAI Announces GPT-5"
  risk_score: number; // 85 (HIGH RISK)
  trend: "up" | "down"; // ↑ Increased 15 points
  category: string; // "Product Launch"
  summary: string; // AI-generated overview
  impact_areas: string[]; // ["Market Share", "Pricing Pressure"]
  recommendations: string[]; // Actionable next steps
  sources: Source[]; // You.com citations (shows API depth)
  confidence: number; // 92% (AI transparency)
  you_apis_used: string[]; // ["News", "Search", "Agents", "ARI"]
  processing_time: string; // "Generated in 4m 32s"
}
```

**Visual Design**:

- **Risk Score**: Large gauge chart (red >70, yellow 40-70, green <40)
- **Trend**: Arrow indicator with percentage change
- **Sources**: Expandable list showing You.com API diversity
- **You.com Badge**: "Powered by You.com APIs" with logos

## 🎬 The Winning Pitch

**Opening Hook (15s)**:

> "Product managers at Meta, Google, and startups waste 10+ hours every week manually tracking competitors. We built a solution that does it in 5 minutes using You.com."

**Live Demo (90s)**:

1. Show watchlist: "Let's monitor OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind"
2. Add competitor: Type "Mistral AI" → News API populates real-time
3. Click Impact Card: Show risk score, AI analysis, source citations
4. Highlight You.com: "This analysis used all 4 You.com APIs in sequence"

**Technical Deep-Dive (45s)**:

> "We orchestrate You.com's News API for monitoring, Search for context, Custom Agents for analysis, and ARI for 400-source research. This creates the first AI competitive intelligence platform."

**Closing (30s)**:

> "This is only possible because You.com combines search depth, AI agents, and research breadth in one platform. We're turning competitive chaos into strategic clarity."

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Get You.com API Keys**: Full access to News, Search, Agents, ARI
2. **Build API Client**: With retry logic for demo stability
3. **Create Impact Card UI**: The memorable centerpiece
4. **Practice Demo Flow**: One perfect 3-minute presentation
5. **Polish & Test**: Ensure no crashes during judging

**Remember**: One excellent You.com API showcase > three mediocre features. Focus on depth over breadth to win!
