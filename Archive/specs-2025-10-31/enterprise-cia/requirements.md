# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enterprise Competitive Intelligence Agent (CIA) is an AI-powered competitive intelligence system that automates monitoring and analysis of competitors, markets, and regulations. The system serves both enterprise teams and individual researchers by transforming information overload into actionable insights through real-time intelligence with <5-minute latency, AI-powered analysis using You.com APIs, and explainable insights with full source provenance.

The system addresses two primary markets: enterprise teams (product managers, strategy teams, executives) requiring comprehensive competitive monitoring, and individual users (job seekers, investors, entrepreneurs, researchers) needing quick company and market research capabilities.
