## 🎬 Director's Notes

1. **First 10 seconds are CRITICAL**: Hook the viewer immediately
2. **Show, don't tell**: Let the UI speak for itself where possible
3. **Build momentum**: Start slow, increase pace in middle, strong finish
4. **Highlight differentiation**: Emphasize "all 4 APIs" - this is unique
5. **Real data only**: No mock data, show actual API responses
6. **Professional polish**: Smooth transitions, no glitches
