## 🎯 Cleanup Objectives

This cleanup consolidated and archived temporary files, analysis reports, and completed project artifacts while maintaining a clean, organized documentation structure for ongoing development and hackathon presentation.

## 📁 Files Archived

### Analysis Reports → `Archive/analysis-2025-10-31/`

**Moved Files:**

- `ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` → `Archive/analysis-2025-10-31/ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`
- `ANALYSIS_DETAILED_FINDINGS.md` → `Archive/analysis-2025-10-31/ANALYSIS_DETAILED_FINDINGS.md`
- `FIXES_SUMMARY.md` → `Archive/analysis-2025-10-31/FIXES_SUMMARY.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md` → `Archive/analysis-2025-10-31/CHANGELOG.md`

**Reason:** These were one-time analysis reports from the October 2025 code review. All issues identified have been resolved, making these historical documents.

### Project Specifications → `Archive/specs-2025-10-31/`

**Moved Files:**

- `.kiro/specs/enterprise-cia/` → `Archive/specs-2025-10-31/enterprise-cia/`
  - `design.md` - Original design specifications
  - `hackathon-focus.md` - Hackathon strategy (completed)
  - `requirements.md` - Initial requirements (implemented)
  - `tasks-hackathon.md` - Task list (completed ✅)
  - `tasks.md` - General task tracking (completed)

**Reason:** These specification files represent completed planning phases. The hackathon tasks are marked as completed, and the design has been fully implemented.
