## You.com API Integration

### Integration Pattern Assessment

The platform successfully integrates all 4 You.com APIs with both sequential and parallel workflows:

```python
# Multi-agent orchestration pattern (new)
async def generate_comprehensive_intelligence(...):
    # Parallel agent execution
    research_task = research_agent.analyze(competitor)
    analysis_task = analysis_agent.evaluate(context)
    strategy_task = strategy_agent.recommend(insights)

    # Coordinated results assembly
    results = await asyncio.gather(research_task, analysis_task, strategy_task)
    return orchestrator.assemble_intelligence(results)

# Original sequential pattern (still available)
async def generate_impact_card(...):
    news_data = await self.fetch_news(news_query)
    context_data = await self.search_context(search_query)
    analysis_data = await self.analyze_impact(news_data, context_data, competitor)
