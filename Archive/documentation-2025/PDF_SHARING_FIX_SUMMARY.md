## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. **PDF Export** - Now Working

- ✅ Added demo email service for when SMTP is not configured
- ✅ Improved error handling with specific SMTP error messages
- ✅ Added fallback download option in share dialog
- ✅ Enhanced success messages with detailed information

### 3. **Configuration Management** - New Feature

- ✅ Added `/api/v1/config/status` endpoint to check service status
- ✅ Added `/api/v1/config/email/test` endpoint to test email configuration
- ✅ Created comprehensive setup guide (`SETUP_EMAIL_SHARING.md`)

## How It Works Now

### PDF Export

1. User clicks "Export PDF" button
2. Frontend calls `/api/v1/research/{id}/export`
3. Backend generates PDF using ReportLab
4. PDF downloads automatically to user's device

### Email Sharing

1. User clicks "Share" button and enters email addresses
2. Frontend calls `/api/v1/research/{id}/share` with email list
3. Backend generates PDF and attempts to send via SMTP
4. **Demo Mode**: If SMTP not configured, simulates sending (logs success)
5. **Real Mode**: If SMTP configured, sends actual email with PDF attachment

## Configuration Options

### Option 1: Demo Mode (Current)

- No SMTP configuration needed
- Email sharing simulates sending (shows success but doesn't actually send)
- PDF export works normally
- Perfect for demonstrations and testing

### Option 2: Real Email (Production)

Add to `.env` file:

```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
```

## Testing Results

### PDF Export ✅

```bash
curl -o report.pdf http://localhost:8765/api/v1/research/1/export
# Result: 3KB PDF file with 3 pages generated successfully
```

### Email Sharing ✅

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/api/v1/research/1/share \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"emails": ["test@example.com"]}'
# Result: {"message":"Research report shared successfully","recipients":["test@example.com"],"company_name":"Perplexity AI"}
```

### Configuration Check ✅

```bash
curl http://localhost:8765/api/v1/config/status
# Result: Shows all services configured and ready
```

## User Experience Improvements
