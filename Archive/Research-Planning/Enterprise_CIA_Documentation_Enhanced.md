## Product Vision & Strategy

### Problem Statement

Enterprise teams face critical competitive intelligence challenges:

**Information Overload:**
- 500+ news articles per day per competitor
- 200+ regulatory updates per quarter
- 50+ product launches per month in category

**Delayed Detection:**
- Average 5-7 days to detect competitive moves manually
- 12-20 hours to research and brief teams
- Missed opportunities cost $100K-$500K per incident

**Lack of Actionability:**
- Raw information without analysis
- No impact assessment or prioritization
- Unclear ownership and next steps

**No Provenance:**
- Unable to verify AI-generated insights
- No source traceability
- Low confidence in recommendations

**Projected Time Savings with CIA:**
- **Automated monitoring:** -4.2 hours (reading news) → 0.5 hours (reviewing Impact Cards)
- **Automated research:** -5.1 hours (researching) → 1.2 hours (reviewing ARI reports)
- **Auto-generated briefs:** -2.4 hours (briefing) → 0.8 hours (customizing briefs)
- **Auto-updated battlecards:** -1.6 hours → 0.3 hours (reviewing updates)
- **Regulatory alerts:** -1.3 hours → 0.2 hours (reviewing alerts)

**Total Savings:** 12.3 → 2.1 hours = **10.2 hours saved/week (83% reduction)**

**Supporting Quotes:**
> "I spend at least 5 hours every week just trying to understand what our competitors launched. It's exhausting and I always feel like I'm missing something."
> — PM at Series C marketing automation company

> "My CEO asks me weekly 'what's [competitor] up to?' and I scramble to Google everything. I'd pay $200/month to not have that panic."
> — Senior PM at Series B HR tech company

> "We had a competitor launch a feature we were building, and we didn't find out for 8 days. Lost us 2 key deals."
> — PM at Series D analytics platform

**Validation Plan for Beta:**
- Track time savings via weekly surveys (n=10 beta users)
- Compare competitive awareness (# of moves detected) vs. manual baseline
- Measure NPS after 30 days
- Target: ≥8 hours saved/week avg across cohort

      - truncate to first 100 characters

  fuzzy_matching:
    algorithm: "Levenshtein distance"
    threshold: 0.85
    fields: ["title", "snippet"]

  canonicalization_rules:
    preference_order:
      1. "Most complete article (highest word count)"
      2. "Highest source credibility score"
      3. "Most recent publication date"

## Source Credibility Framework

### Publisher Tier System

**Tier 1: Authoritative (Credibility: 0.85-1.0)**
- **Criteria:** Established editorial standards, fact-checking, journalistic reputation
- **Examples:** Wall Street Journal, Reuters, Bloomberg, Financial Times, Associated Press
- **Verification:** Manual editorial review + Alexa rank <10K + Domain age >5 years
- **Use Case:** High-risk Impact Cards require Tier 1 sources

**Tier 2: Reputable (Credibility: 0.65-0.84)**
- **Criteria:** Industry-recognized publications with editorial oversight
- **Examples:** TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Ars Technica, The Information, Business Insider
- **Verification:** Domain age >3 years + Known editorial staff + Cited by Tier 1 sources
- **Use Case:** Medium-risk Impact Cards, corroboration sources

**Tier 3: Community (Credibility: 0.45-0.64)**
- **Criteria:** User-generated content with moderation, specialized forums
- **Examples:** Hacker News, Reddit (verified posts), Medium (verified authors), Substack (known authors)
- **Verification:** Upvote/moderation systems + Author verification
- **Use Case:** Early signals, trends, lower-risk events

**Tier 4: Unverified (Credibility: 0.20-0.44)**
- **Criteria:** Blogs, social media, unverified sources
- **Examples:** Personal blogs, Twitter/X posts, unknown Substack, press releases
- **Treatment:** Flagged for manual review, not used alone for high-risk cards

**Tier 5: Low Trust (Credibility: 0.0-0.19)**
- **Criteria:** Known misinformation sources, satire, spam
- **Treatment:** Filtered out, not shown to users

### Credibility Score Calculation

```python
def calculate_source_credibility(source: NewsSource) -> float:
    """
    Calculate source credibility score (0.0-1.0)

    Components:
    - Base tier score (0.4 weight)
    - Recency penalty (0.2 weight)
    - Cross-corroboration bonus (0.2 weight)
    - Breaking news penalty (0.2 weight)
    """
    # Base tier score from publisher database
    base_score = get_publisher_tier_score(source.publisher)

    # Recency: newer = slightly less reliable until corroborated
    recency_factor = 1.0
    age_hours = (datetime.now() - source.published_at).total_seconds() / 3600
    if age_hours < 2:
        recency_factor = 0.85  # 15% penalty for <2 hour old news

    # Cross-corroboration: bonus if other sources confirm
    corroboration_bonus = min(source.corroboration_count * 0.05, 0.15)

    # Breaking news: slight penalty until verified
    breaking_penalty = -0.10 if source.is_breaking else 0.0

    final_score = (
        base_score * 0.4 +
        (base_score * recency_factor) * 0.2 +
        corroboration_bonus * 0.2 +
        (base_score + breaking_penalty) * 0.2
    )

    return max(0.0, min(1.0, final_score))
```

### Credibility Thresholds for Impact Cards

**Risk-Based Requirements:**

| Risk Level | Min Sources | Min Avg Credibility | Tier Requirements |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Critical (81-100)** | ≥3 | ≥0.80 | At least 2 Tier 1 sources |
| **High (61-80)** | ≥2 | ≥0.75 | At least 1 Tier 1 source |
| **Medium (31-60)** | ≥2 | ≥0.65 | At least 1 Tier 2 source |
| **Low (0-30)** | ≥1 | ≥0.50 | Any verified source |

**Special Cases:**
- **Breaking News (<2 hours old):** Require +1 additional source or manual review
- **Regulatory Events:** Require primary source (government website) or Tier 1 confirmation
- **Security Incidents:** Require vendor statement + independent verification
- **Single Source Events:** Flag with "Single source - verify independently" badge

## Technical Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: You.com API Rate Limits

**Risk Level:** HIGH
**Impact:** News ingestion delays, broken user experience

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Rate Limit Awareness:**
- Monitor API usage via dashboard (already built in MVP)
- Track calls per minute/hour/day per API endpoint
- Alert at 80% of known/estimated limits

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:** (Already implemented)
```python
class YouAPIManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker(
            failure_threshold=5,
            recovery_timeout=60
        )

    async def robust_news_fetch(self, keywords):
        try:
            async with self.circuit_breaker:
                return await you_client.news.stream(keywords)
        except APIException as e:
            # Fallback to cached data
            return await self.get_cached_news(keywords)
```

**Caching Strategy:**
- **News API:** Cache results for 15 minutes (reduces redundant calls)
- **Search API:** Cache enrichment results for 1 hour (high reuse potential)
- **Custom Agent:** Cache extraction results indefinitely (immutable once extracted)
- **ARI:** Cache reports for 7 days (deep research rarely changes)

**Graceful Degradation:**
- **News API throttled** → Show cached news with "Last updated X min ago" badge
- **Search API throttled** → Skip enrichment, use news content only
- **Custom Agent throttled** → Queue for processing, show "Analysis pending"
- **ARI throttled** → Show "Report generation delayed, check back in 10 min"

**Quota Management:**
- Set daily quotas per watchlist (prevent runaway costs)
- Alert admin at 80% daily quota
- Hard stop at 100% quota with manual override capability

### Risk 2: Vendor Lock-in to You.com

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Dependency on single provider for core functionality

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Abstraction Layer:**
All You.com API calls via `you_client.py` wrapper with provider-agnostic interfaces:

```python
class NewsProvider(Protocol):
    async def fetch_news(self, keywords: list[str]) -> list[NewsItem]: ...

class SearchProvider(Protocol):
    async def enrich(self, query: str) -> list[SearchResult]: ...

class ExtractionProvider(Protocol):
    async def extract(self, content: str, prompt: str) -> dict: ...

class ResearchProvider(Protocol):
    async def deep_research(self, query: str) -> Report: ...
```

**Alternative Providers (Future):**
- **News API** → NewsAPI.org, Bing News API, Google News RSS
- **Search API** → Brave Search API, Bing Search API, Serper
- **Custom Agent** → OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini
- **ARI** → LangChain + Tavily + GPT-4, Perplexity API

**Multi-Provider Strategy (Post-MVP):**
- Use You.com as primary (best performance + integration)
- Fallback to alternatives on failure or quota exhaustion
- Allow users to configure provider preferences
- A/B test providers for quality comparison

### Risk 3: API Cost Explosion at Scale

**Risk Level:** HIGH (at 1000+ users)
**Impact:** Unprofitable unit economics, unsustainable burn rate

**Cost Analysis (Per User Per Month):**

| You.com API | Est Cost/Call | Calls/User/Day | Daily Cost/User | Monthly Cost/User |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **News API** | $0.02 | 48 (2/hour) | $0.96 | $28.80 |
| **Search API** | $0.01 | 120 (5/article × 24 articles) | $1.20 | $36.00 |
| **Custom Agent** | $0.05 | 30 (high-value only) | $1.50 | $45.00 |
| **ARI** | $0.50 | 2 (on-demand) | $1.00 | $30.00 |
| **TOTAL** | - | - | **$4.66** | **$139.80** |

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Pricing Tiers with Cost Alignment:**
- **Starter ($49/month):** 5 watchlists, 50 Impact Cards/month, 2 ARI reports
  → Cost: $45/month → **Margin: 8%** (acceptable for freemium)
- **Professional ($199/month):** 25 watchlists, 500 Impact Cards/month, 10 ARI reports
  → Cost: $120/month → **Margin: 40%** (healthy SaaS margin)
- **Enterprise ($999/month):** Unlimited, custom SLA
  → Cost: $300/month → **Margin: 70%** (target for enterprise)

**Cost Optimization:**
- **Batch News API calls:** 1 call → 10 watchlists via keyword OR (90% reduction)
- **Cache duplicate Search queries:** 30% reduction via deduplication
- **Lazy-load ARI reports:** On-demand only, not auto-generated (80% reduction)
- **Risk-based Custom Agent usage:** Only trigger for risk >60 (50% reduction)

**Target Economics:** <30% COGS at Professional tier by Month 6

**Cost Monitoring:**
- Real-time cost dashboard per tenant
- Budget alerts at 80% monthly quota
- Automatic throttling at 100% quota
- Monthly cost attribution reports

### Risk 4: Data Privacy & Compliance

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (Enterprise buyers)
**Impact:** Deal blockers from legal/security teams, regulatory fines

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**SOC 2 Type 2 Audit:**
- Complete by Month 12 ($15-30K cost)
- Covers security, availability, processing integrity
- Annual audit for renewal

**GDPR Compliance:**
- Data processing addendum with You.com
- User data export workflows (JSON/CSV)
- Right to deletion (30-day fulfillment)
- Cookie consent management (OneTrust/Cookiebot)
- Privacy policy + terms of service (lawyer-reviewed)

**Data Residency:**
- Offer EU/US regions (AWS multi-region deployment)
- Data never crosses region boundaries
- Compliance with EU data sovereignty requirements

**Encryption Standards:**
- **In Transit:** TLS 1.3 for all API communication
- **At Rest:** AES-256 for RDS PostgreSQL encryption
- **Field-Level:** Encrypt PII fields (names, emails) separately
- **Key Management:** AWS KMS with automatic rotation

**Audit Logging:**
- Immutable logs via AWS CloudTrail + S3 Object Lock
- Log all user actions (create/read/update/delete)
- Tamper-evident with SHA-256 hashing
- Retention: 7 years (compliance requirement)

### Risk 5: Competitive Intelligence Arms Race

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Competitors build similar solutions, commoditization

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Moat Building:**
- **Data Network Effects:** More users → more watchlists → better event coverage → more users
- **Proprietary Event Taxonomy:** 14 event types with 500+ labeled examples
- **Custom Confidence Scoring:** Unique algorithm with 4 weighted components
- **Publisher Credibility Database:** Hand-curated tier system
- **Integration Depth:** Deep You.com API integration (4 APIs) hard to replicate

**Continuous Innovation:**
- Weekly product updates based on user feedback
- Monthly new event type additions
- Quarterly major feature releases
- Annual architecture reviews

**Customer Lock-in (Ethical):**
- Historical Impact Card database (switching cost)
- Custom watchlist configurations (setup investment)
- Integration ecosystem (Slack, Teams, Jira)
- Training and onboarding investments

## Glossary

### Core Concepts

**Impact Card**: A structured intelligence briefing generated by the CIA system that summarizes a competitive event, assesses multi-dimensional risk, recommends actions, and provides source provenance. Each Impact Card includes event type, risk score, confidence score, affected products, and recommended actions with ownership.

**WatchItem**: A user-configured monitoring target (e.g., "Acme Corp", "GDPR changes") defined by keywords, competitors, or regulatory topics. The system monitors news and web sources for mentions matching WatchItem criteria.

**NewsItem**: A single news article or web page ingested from You.com News API, enriched with entities and metadata, and matched to one or more WatchItems based on keyword relevance.

**Extraction Result**: The structured output from You.com Custom Agent that extracts competitive intelligence from a NewsItem, including event type, impact axes, entities, and recommended actions in JSON format.

**ARI (Advanced Research Intelligence)**: You.com's deep research API that generates comprehensive reports by analyzing 400+ sources. Used in CIA for on-demand "Deep Dive" reports on specific competitive events.

### Event Classification

**Event Taxonomy**: The classification system for competitive events with 14 categories: Launch, PricingChange, Partnership, Regulatory, SecurityIncident, M&A, Funding, Hiring, Layoff, FeatureUpdate, Outage, Rebranding, MarketExpansion.

**Event Type**: The category assigned to a competitive event (e.g., "Launch" for new product releases). Determines risk assessment logic and recommended action templates.

**Deduplication**: The process of identifying and merging duplicate news articles about the same event from different sources, using fuzzy matching on titles (Levenshtein distance >0.85) and publication dates.

**Canonicalization**: The process of selecting the primary article from multiple duplicates based on completeness (word count), source credibility, recency, and breaking news status.

### Scoring & Analysis

**Confidence Score**: A mathematical measure (0.0-1.0) of how certain the system is about its extraction and analysis, calculated from source credibility (40%), corroboration (20%), extraction quality (20%), and recency (20%).

**Risk Score**: A multi-dimensional assessment (0-100) of potential business impact across five dimensions: market (30%), product (30%), pricing (20%), regulatory (10%), and brand (10%). Used to prioritize Impact Cards.

**Risk Level**: Classification of risk score into four tiers: Low (0-30), Medium (31-60), High (61-80), Critical (81-100). Determines notification urgency and required source credibility.

**Source Credibility**: A score (0.0-1.0) assigned to news publishers based on tier system (Tier 1: 0.85-1.0, Tier 2: 0.65-0.84, Tier 3: 0.45-0.64). Used in confidence score calculation.

**Corroboration**: The degree to which multiple independent sources report the same competitive event, increasing confidence by +0.05 per additional source (max +0.15).

### Data & Processing

**Source Provenance**: Full traceability of information back to original sources, including clickable links, publisher names, publication dates, and credibility scores. Ensures every claim in an Impact Card can be verified.

**Entity Extraction**: Using Natural Language Processing (NER - Named Entity Recognition) to identify companies (ORG), products (PRODUCT), people (PERSON), and other key entities mentioned in news articles via spaCy.

**Custom Agent**: You.com's AI agent API that executes structured extraction tasks using custom prompts. CIA uses Custom Agents to analyze NewsItems and extract competitive intelligence in JSON format according to predefined schemas.

**Rules DSL**: A YAML-based domain-specific language for defining business logic that determines risk levels, action recommendations, and ownership routing based on extracted intelligence patterns.

### Resilience & Operations

**Circuit Breaker**: A resilience pattern that prevents cascading failures when external APIs (like You.com) are unavailable, automatically falling back to cached data or degraded modes after 5 consecutive failures.

**Graceful Degradation**: System behavior that maintains partial functionality when external dependencies fail, e.g., showing cached news when News API is throttled, or queuing extractions when Custom Agent is unavailable.

**Rate Limiting**: Quota management system that tracks You.com API usage and prevents over-consumption through caching, batching, and automatic throttling at configurable thresholds.

**SLA (Service Level Agreement)**: Performance commitments including 99.9% uptime, <5 minute news-to-card latency, <500ms p95 API response time, and <2 minute ARI report generation.

### Metrics & Evaluation

**Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives). Measures accuracy of event detection. Target: >85%.

**Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives). Measures completeness of event detection. Target: >80%.

**F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall: 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall). Overall detection quality metric. Target: >82%.

**False Positive Rate**: False positives / (False positives + True negatives). Measures incorrect event detections. Target: <12% overall.

**Time to Detection**: Latency from event publication (source timestamp) to Impact Card generation (system timestamp). Target: <5 minutes.
