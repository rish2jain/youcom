## 🚫 Issues Resolved

### Original Problem

The original `scripts/automated_demo_cross_platform.js` was failing with:

```
❌ Demo failed: ErrorEvent socket hang up
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'screenshot')
```

### Root Cause

- WebSocket connection issues with Chrome DevTools Protocol
- Puppeteer browser launch configuration problems
- Missing error handling for page disconnections

### Solution Applied

1. **Explicit Chrome Path**: Used direct Chrome executable path instead of auto-detection
2. **Robust Error Handling**: Added null checks and try-catch blocks
3. **Simplified Configuration**: Reduced Chrome launch arguments to essential ones
4. **Connection Verification**: Added browser connection testing before operations
