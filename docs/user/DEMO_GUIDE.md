## 📊 Extended Demo (9 Minutes)

### The Hook (30 seconds)

"Good morning. Product managers spend hours each week manually tracking competitors across multiple sources. Even with existing CI platforms, it still takes 2-4 hours per week of manual curation. Investors spend 2-4 hours researching a single company.

We built a platform that automates this - using **all four You.com APIs** working together in real-time.

This is Enterprise CIA - the **only platform** orchestrating complete You.com API workflows for competitive intelligence."

### The Problem (90 seconds)

"Let me explain the problem we're solving.

**For enterprise teams** - product managers, strategists, executives - competitive intelligence is constant manual work. You're monitoring news across multiple sources, synthesizing market moves, tracking what competitors are doing. It consumes hours each week.

Even with existing competitive intelligence platforms like Crayon or Klue, you still need significant manual curation - typically 2-4 hours per week just to keep things updated. And you're still discovering competitive moves days or weeks late, always playing catch-up.

**For individual researchers** - job seekers, investors, entrepreneurs - researching a single company takes 2-4 hours manually. You're limited to whatever sources you can find yourself. And professional-grade intelligence tools? Those are built for enterprises, not individuals.

Why can't they use existing solutions?

- **GPT-4 variants have different training cutoffs** - the original GPT-4 (September 2021) and newer variants like GPT-4o (June 2024) are still months behind for real-time competitive intelligence
- **Google Alerts** floods you with noise but provides zero analysis or synthesis
- **Manual research** is slow, incomplete, and inconsistent across team members
- **Enterprise CI tools** are expensive and still require substantial hands-on work

This is the gap we're filling."

### The Solution (90 seconds)

"Here's our solution: **complete You.com API orchestration**.

We start with the **News API** - monitoring competitors 24/7 with keyword alerts, detecting moves in under 60 seconds, with 5-tier credibility scoring to filter signal from noise.

Then the **Search API** enriches those signals with market context - instant company profiles, competitive landscape, current pricing and positioning intelligence.

Next, our **Custom Agent** - purpose-built for competitive intelligence - analyzes the strategic impact with multi-dimensional threat scoring across market, product, regulatory, and brand dimensions.

Finally, the **ARI API** synthesizes across **400 web sources** to create comprehensive research reports with full provenance and balanced perspectives from authoritative sources.

All of this happens automatically in under 3 minutes.

Now here's the critical part - why we needed You.com specifically:

- GPT-4's training cutoff is June 2024. For competitive intelligence, you need **current** intelligence, not months-old data. You.com's News API provides that.
- Generic search can't give you the structured, reliable analysis businesses need. You.com's Custom Agent does.
- Manual research can't scale to 400 sources in minutes. You.com's ARI can.
- We need source transparency with credibility scoring for enterprise compliance. Only You.com provides this level of provenance.

This orchestration - all four APIs working together - is what makes professional-grade intelligence possible."

### Live Demo - Enterprise (90 seconds)

[Navigate to watchlist/company search]

"Let's say I'm a PM at Anthropic monitoring OpenAI. I'll add them as a competitor with relevant keywords - GPT models, ChatGPT developments, AI model launches.

[Click 'Generate Impact Card']

Now watch this happen in real-time.

[Narrate as processing]

See the progress indicators? The **News API** is detecting recent OpenAI announcements...

Now the **Search API** is pulling market context and competitive landscape data...

The **Custom Agent** is analyzing strategic implications and calculating threat scores...

And the **ARI API** is synthesizing intelligence from over 400 sources across the web...

[When results appear]

Here we go. Look at this - **threat score** with multi-dimensional analysis.

Impact assessment across product features, pricing strategy, and market positioning. And look - **over 400 sources cited**, each with credibility scores so you know what's authoritative and what isn't.

Specific recommended actions based on this intelligence - not just data, actual strategic guidance.

One click - professional report ready to share with executives.

That took under 3 minutes. The manual process? Days or weeks of monitoring, research, and synthesis."

### Live Demo - Individual (60 seconds)

[Navigate to new company search]

"Different perspective now. I'm preparing for an interview at Perplexity AI tomorrow. I need comprehensive company research fast.

**ARI** is pulling comprehensive research from 400 sources - funding history, growth signals, competitive advantages, recent news...

[When results load]

There it is. Complete company overview. Funding history showing their Series B round. Key competitors automatically identified. Recent partnerships and product launches - all synthesized from hundreds of authoritative sources.

Export to PDF, and I'm ready for my interview tomorrow.

**Two minutes**. The manual version? I'd spend 4 hours going through Crunchbase, news sites, their website, LinkedIn... This does it all automatically."
