## Screenshot Sequence and Narration

### 01_dashboard_home.png

**Narration:** "Good morning. This is Enterprise CIA - the only platform orchestrating complete You.com API workflows for competitive intelligence. Product managers spend hours each week manually tracking competitors. We built a platform that automates this using all four You.com APIs working together in real-time."

### 02_onboarding_complete.png

**Narration:** "Let me show you how this works. I'm setting up as Anthropic in the AI industry to demonstrate enterprise competitive monitoring."

### 03_enterprise_dashboard.png

**Narration:** "Here's our solution: complete You.com API orchestration. The dashboard shows real-time competitive intelligence with threat scoring. Notice how it's automatically personalized for AI competitors - OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Google DeepMind."

### 04_dashboard_with_ai_competitors.png

**Narration:** "Each competitor gets multi-dimensional threat analysis. OpenAI shows a 9.8/10 threat score with GPT-5 launch details. This is the News API detecting signals in under 60 seconds, with 5-tier credibility scoring."

### 05_application_overview.png

**Narration:** "The platform provides comprehensive analysis - 387 sources for OpenAI, 412 for Anthropic, 437 for Google DeepMind. All synthesized automatically with full provenance tracking."

### 06_api_architecture_showcase.png

**Narration:** "Here's the critical part - why we needed You.com specifically. Four APIs working together: News API for real-time detection, Search API for context enrichment, Custom Agents for structured analysis, and ARI for 400+ source synthesis. This orchestration is what makes professional-grade intelligence possible."

### 07_dashboard_insights_section.png

**Narration:** "The system provides actionable insights: 40% increase in competitor activity this week, 3 major announcements detected, with the highest threat being OpenAI's $300B valuation requiring immediate strategic response."

### 08_quick_actions_section.png

**Narration:** "Quick actions let you add competitors, research new companies, monitor in real-time, and configure settings. This took under 3 minutes to generate. The manual process? Days or weeks of monitoring, research, and synthesis."
