---

## Product Vision

### **Problem Statement**

Enterprise teams face information overload when tracking competitors:

- **Manual Monitoring:** Hours spent reading news, blogs, press releases
- **Missed Signals:** Important competitive moves discovered too late
- **Information Fragmentation:** Data scattered across multiple sources
- **No Actionability:** Raw information without analysis or recommendations
- **Lack of Provenance:** Unable to verify claims or trace insights to sources

### **Solution**

An intelligent agent that transforms competitive noise into actionable intelligence:

```
Raw Information → Intelligent Analysis → Actionable Insights
(News, Search)  →  (AI Extraction)   →  (Impact Cards + Actions)
```

### **Value Proposition**

**For Product Managers:**
- Detect competitor product launches within minutes
- Understand feature parity gaps with evidence
- Prioritize competitive responses based on impact

**For Strategy Teams:**
- Track market trends and strategic partnerships
- Identify threats and opportunities early
- Generate executive briefings automatically

**For Compliance:**
- Monitor regulatory changes affecting your industry
- Assess policy impact on products and operations
- Generate compliance action checklists

### **Impact Extraction Prompt**

```text
# prompts/impact_extraction.txt

System: You are an enterprise competitive intelligence extraction agent.
Your role is to analyze news and web content to identify competitive impacts
with precision and source provenance.

Given:
- News headline and content
- Enriched context from web search
- Company watchlist keywords
- Our product portfolio

Extract the following in strict JSON format:

1. event_type (one of: product_launch, pricing_change, regulatory_action,
   partnership, acquisition, outage, leadership_change, funding, market_expansion)

2. affected_products (list of our products that overlap or compete;
   infer from keywords and product descriptions)

3. impact_axes (list of objects with axis, level, and rationale):
   - market: Impact on market dynamics, customer segments, demand
   - product: Impact on product strategy, features, roadmap
   - regulatory: Compliance, legal, policy implications

   Levels: high (immediate action required), medium (monitor and plan),
           low (awareness only)

4. recommended_actions (list of objects with owner, action, due_days, priority):
   - owner: functional owner (PM, Marketing, Legal, Sales, etc.)
   - action: specific actionable task
   - due_days: suggested timeline (1-7 days)
   - priority: high, medium, low

5. sources (list of title + URL pairs for provenance)

6. confidence (0.0 to 1.0 score for extraction quality)

Rules:
- Be conservative in impact level assessment
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Always cite sources
- If uncertain, reduce confidence score
- Focus on business impact, not technical details

User Input:
News: {{ headline.title }} — {{ headline.url }}
Published: {{ headline.published_at }}
Content: {{ headline.raw_text }}

Watch Keywords: {{ watch.keywords }}
Our Products: {{ company_products }}

Context Docs (from Search API):
{{ context_docs }}

Return strict JSON only, no explanation.

### **Devpost Submission Components**

**1. 200-Word Project Description**

```
The Enterprise Competitive Intelligence Agent (CIA) automates competitive
monitoring for product teams and executives. It continuously ingests news
from You.com's News API, enriches each story with Search API context, and
uses Custom Agents to extract structured competitive intelligence.

The system generates Impact Cards that explain what happened, which products
are affected, the level of risk, and recommended actions—all with full source
provenance. For deeper analysis, users can trigger on-demand research reports
via You.com's ARI, generating 400-source analyses in under 2 minutes.

CIA solves the information overload problem: instead of manually tracking
competitors across dozens of sources, teams receive actionable intelligence
with clear ownership and timelines. Early users report saving 10+ hours per
week and detecting competitive moves 3-5 days earlier.

Built with FastAPI, Next.js, and 4 You.com APIs (News, Search, Custom Agents,
ARI), CIA demonstrates the power of agentic workflows for enterprise intelligence.
