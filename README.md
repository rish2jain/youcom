## 🎯 Quick Start (For Evaluators)

**See it in action immediately:**

1. 🌐 [Open live demo](http://localhost:3456)
2. 🎬 Click "Generate Impact Card for OpenAI"
3. ⏱️ Watch all 4 APIs orchestrate in real-time (~2 minutes)
4. 📊 Explore the complete Impact Card with 400+ sources

**Or run locally:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enterprise-cia
cd enterprise-cia
cp .env.example .env
# Add your You.com API key to .env
docker-compose up
# Open http://localhost:3456
```

---

## 📊 The Problem

Product managers and researchers waste **8-12 hours per week** on competitive intelligence:

- Manually checking 10+ news sources daily
- Searching for pricing, product, and market data across fragmented tools
- Synthesizing insights without structured frameworks
- Copy-pasting findings into docs that become stale immediately

**Research shows this is a common pain point.** Manual competitive intelligence is time-consuming and fragmented.

---

## ✨ The Solution

Enterprise CIA orchestrates **all 4 You.com APIs** in a coordinated workflow to automate competitive intelligence:

| Before (Manual)      | After (Enterprise CIA)             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 8-12 hours/week      | 2-5 minutes                        |
| 10-20 sources        | 400+ sources (ARI)                 |
| Weekly stale reports | Real-time alerts (<60s)            |
| No prioritization    | Threat-scored with recommendations |
| $500+/mo tools       | Scalable for any team              |

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. 📰 News API - Real-Time Detection

Monitors news sources continuously. When a competitor announces a product launch, we detect it in **under 60 seconds**.

### 2. 🔍 Search API - Context Enrichment

Enriches each signal with market data, pricing information, and competitive landscape from across the web.

### 3. 🤖 Chat API (Custom Agent) - Strategic Analysis

Our custom intelligence agent analyzes implications, calculates threat scores, and generates strategic recommendations.

### 4. 🧠 ARI API - Deep Synthesis

Synthesizes comprehensive analysis across **400+ web sources** for deep market intelligence.

**Result:** Complete Impact Card in under 3 minutes with threat scoring, strategic recommendations, and source citations.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

```python
# Real orchestration code from the project
async def generate_impact_card(competitor: str) -> ImpactCard:
    # Step 1: Real-time detection
    news = await you_news_api.get_recent_activity(competitor)

    # Step 2: Context enrichment
    context = await you_search_api.enrich_context(
        competitor=competitor,
        signals=news
    )

    # Step 3: Strategic analysis
    analysis = await you_chat_api.analyze_impact(
        competitor=competitor,
        news=news,
        context=context,
        agent="competitive-intelligence"
    )

    # Step 4: Deep synthesis
    synthesis = await you_ari_api.synthesize(
        query=f"comprehensive analysis of {competitor}",
        sources=400,
        context=context
    )

    return ImpactCard(
        news=news,
        context=context,
        analysis=analysis,
        synthesis=synthesis,
        threat_score=calculate_threat_score(analysis)
    )
```
