## 🎯 Project Overview

Enterprise CIA is an AI-powered competitive intelligence system that transforms information overload into actionable insights using **all 4 You.com APIs**. The MVP focuses on **individual users** (job seekers, investors, entrepreneurs, researchers, consultants) with enterprise features planned for the next version.

### 🚀 You.com API Integration (THE CENTERPIECE)

This project showcases **complete integration** of all 4 You.com APIs:

1. **📰 News API** - Real-time competitor monitoring with keyword alerts
2. **🔍 Search API** - Context enrichment and company profile generation
3. **🤖 Chat API (Custom Agents)** - Structured competitive impact analysis
4. **📊 ARI API** - Deep research reports from 400+ sources

**Orchestrated Workflow**: News → Search → Chat → ARI → Impact Card (all automated!)

## 🎬 Demo Scenarios

### MVP Features: Individual User Focus

1. **Quick Company Research**: Enter "Perplexity AI" for instant company analysis
2. **API Orchestration**: Search API + ARI API generate comprehensive profile
3. **Export & Share**: Download PDF report or share via email
4. **Investment Insights**: Funding history, market positioning, growth signals

### Basic Competitive Monitoring

1. **Add Competitor**: Create watchlist for "OpenAI" with keywords ["GPT", "ChatGPT", "API"]
2. **Generate Impact Card**: Click "Generate" to trigger all 4 You.com APIs
3. **Real-time Processing**: Watch progress: News → Search → Chat → ARI → Complete
4. **Impact Analysis**: View risk score, impact areas, and actionable recommendations
5. **Source Transparency**: See all You.com API contributions with full provenance

_Note: Advanced enterprise features (team collaboration, compliance, RBAC) are planned for the next version._

# to generate real Impact Cards and company research artifacts.

# Start FastAPI server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies (from project root)
npm install
